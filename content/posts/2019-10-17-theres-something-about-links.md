Links are a fundamental part of the web. What is a link, wikipedia states:

> In computing, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a reference to data that the reader can follow by clicking or tapping.

Or more simply put, a link is a reference to another webpage. We will try a few links here.

- A local link to the [about page](/en/about)
- An external link to the wikipedia article on [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)
- A link to the site [root](/en/) (i.e. "/en/")
